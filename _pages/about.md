Hello everyone, I am Mani. I am a second year computer engineering student at the University of Science and Technology and I am studying at this university. I am interested in artificial intelligence in financial markets and I hope to be able to enter this industry.

I live at the University of Science and Technology, and if you want to connect, we can meet at the university by coordinating on social media.
