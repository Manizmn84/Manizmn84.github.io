In this post, we want to write the prime number function in Python and explain it.

````markdown
```python
Prime Number
```
````

```python
def IsPrime(number) :
    if number == 1 || number == 0 :
        return False
    for i in range(2,(number //2) +1) :
        if number % i == 0:
            return False

    return True
```
